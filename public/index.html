                <strong>Why would I want tutoring?</strong>
                <div>
                  A few hours of online private tutoring per week will accerate your multi-year process of becoming a competent coder.  Bootcamps are a great alternative but require <a href="https://www.quora.com/Has-anyone-had-a-bad-experience-at-a-programming-bootcamp/answer/John-Uke" target="_blank">large tuitions, quiting your job, and often relocating to another city.</a>
                  <br><br>
                  If you want a more cost-effective personalized experience without the commute, then maybe tutoring is for you.  My most productive hours when learning to code were with a remote screen-shared mentor.

              <div>
                <strong>What will you teach me?</strong>
              </div>
              I recommend starting with the front-end in a "Phase I" manner (below).  If you want to be a full-stack developer, then move on to Phase II.  Despite my Ruby background, I do insist on Javascript because it is the best choice for a <strike>seasoned</strike> new developer; it is widely used, pays the most, and the only way to develop a complete application in one language. 
              <br><br>
              <span class="post-subheader">Phase I</span>
              <br>
              Learn the ins and outs of the front-end with HTML/CSS, Javascript, JQuery, and GitHub.  I place a strong emphasis on Javascript fundamentals to get you using best practices.  In addition to all sorts of challenges, you will work on your own personal blog/portfolio and responsive front-end application project.

                <span class="post-subheader">Phase II</span>
                <br>
                Learn the skills necessary to build out app infrastructures and databases with Node.js, as well as multiple ways of hosting your app on the web.  One of my favorites is Parse, a fast-growing backend-as-a-service that simplifies just about every aspect of a website, allowing you to get up and running in minutes.

              <div>
                <strong>How can I get a job from this?</strong>
              </div>
                The idea that a bootcamp will get you a job is in most cases a myth. From the hundred people I know who attended one, it took on average 3-5 months after graduating to happen. Bootcamp networks cannot sustainably land jobs for the exodus of junior programmers they pop out.
              <br><br>
                The best way to find a job as a programmer is through freelancing.  Doing it builds your professional portfolio and is a great way to make money until you are employable. I can teach you how to find, manage, and do freelance work. For example, start a project slowly; progress is fastest at the beginning and clients will complain when they see this progress slow as the application becomes more advanced. Later, bill the client for <em>fewer</em> hours than it took you to offset the fact that you're being paid to learn.
              <div>
              <br><br>
                <strong>So what's the next step?</strong>
              </div>
                Shoot me an email to schedule a meeting.  I will answer any code questions you have and we can discuss tutoring as an option for you.
