    You applied to <a href="http://www.hackercodingacademy.com/">Hacker: Coding Academy</a>, so I assume you are interested in an efficient method of learning,
    and making a living off of, software development. Unfortunately the school fell through in June when one of the founders lost the location (I wish he would
    take down the site). On the other hand so many people have been reaching out that I have decided to open up a custom cost-effective tutoring program as an
    alternative to the school. You can find out more about it here (link).

    <strong>Why would I want tutoring?</strong>

    <strong>Who are you?</strong>
</div>
<div>
    I was <a href="https://www.coursereport.com/blog/founder-spotlight-john-uke-hacker-coding-academy">recruited to be the CEO/CTO of Hacker Coding Academy</a>
    and am a Dev Bootcamp graduate. I have spent a few summers teaching teenagers front and back-end web development at UCLA, UCSD, UC Berkeley, and Stanford.
I am also the CEO/CTO of <a href="https://www.newvo.me/">NewVo</a>, a peer-to-peer fashion advice app for teenagers on<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/newvo-help-with-outfits/id883925923?mt=8">iOS</a> and    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.newvo.android&amp;hl=en">Android</a>.

    <strong>What will I learn?</strong>

    An advantage to private tutoring is that what you learn and how you learn it is dependent on your own learning style, level of coding expertise, and fields
    of interest (<em>move to why)</em>. When I was at Dev Bootcamp an instructor was sick and worked remotely with me via Screenhero, an app that allowed us to
    code together remotely. The instructor reviewed the code I wrote on a side project, and it was my most productive hour of learning and working I had
    throughout the entire program.

The one thing I do insist on is teaching JavaScript because it is unarguably the most useful, flexible, well-paying, future-oriented option there is.    <a href="http://www.hackercodingacademy.com/faq.html">Learn more</a> about my philosophy on learning.

    <strong>So what's the deal?</strong>
</div>
<div>
    We set up a meeting to learn more about each other and see if tutoring is a good fit for you. I recommend starting off at two 2-hour sessions/week. During
    these sessions I will review your code, explain meta-concepts, and direct you on what to learn next. I will also connect you with any other students at
    similar stages so you can assist and motivate each other with your learning.
</div>
<div>
    A traditional bootcamp runs $10-17,000 and 9-12 weeks. Private tutoring will cost ~20% as much while affording you more personal attention and convenience
    with the option to stop at any time.

    <strong>How will I get a job without going to a bootcamp?</strong>
</div>
<div>
    The idea that your bootcamp will get you a job is in most cases a myth. From the hundred people I know it took on average 3-5 months after graduating to
    happen. Bootcamp networks cannot sustainably land jobs for the exodus of junior programmers they pop out. Needing a job to make it as a software engineer
    is another myth (just look at me), but in any case companies hire programmers based on what they can actually do for the company.

<div>
    Contract/freelance work builds your professional portfolio and is a great way to make money until you are proficient enough for a full-time job (if that is
    what you want). I will teach you how to find, manage, and bug-fix this work. For example, start a project slowly; progress is fastest at the beginning and
    clients will complain when they see this progress slow down as the application becomes more advanced. Then, bill the client for <em>fewer</em> hours to
    offset the fact that you're being paid to learn.
